                    <h1>Our Values</h1>
                    <p>Living in congruence with my values is essential. These values act as a compass, guiding my decisions and actions, ensuring integrity and authenticity in all aspects of my life and work.</p>

                    <h2>Faith and Tenacity</h2>
                    <p>You know, life has a funny way of testing us. It pushes us to the edge, dangles us over the precipice of despair, and whispers, "Give up." It’s in those moments, when the world seems darkest, that the true measure of a person is revealed. It’s easy to shine when everything is going well, but it’s in the face of adversity that our faith and tenacity are truly forged.</p>
                    <p>Faith isn’t just about believing in something greater than ourselves. It’s about believing in the journey, no matter how rough the road gets. It’s about showing up, day after day, even when every fiber of your being is screaming for you to quit. Faith is waking up each morning, staring down your fears, and saying, "Not today."</p>
                    <p>And then there’s tenacity. Ah, tenacity. It’s the grit, the grind, the sheer willpower to keep moving forward, even when it feels like you’re walking through quicksand. It’s falling down seven times and standing up eight. It’s knowing that every failure is just a stepping stone, a lesson learned, a battle scar that makes you stronger.</p>
                    <p>Failures aren’t the end; they’re the beginning. They’re the chapters in our stories that make the victories sweeter. Each setback, each stumble, is a testament to our resilience. We learn, we grow, we adapt. We become better versions of ourselves, molded by the fires of our struggles.</p>
                    <p>There’s a certain beauty in failing. It’s raw, it’s real, it’s human. It’s the universe’s way of stripping us down to our core, revealing our vulnerabilities, and then giving us the strength to rise again. Failure is not a defeat; it’s a badge of honor. It’s proof that we dared to try, that we had the courage to chase our dreams, even if we stumbled along the way.</p>
                    <p>So, show up, even when it hurts. Stand tall, even when the weight of the world is on your shoulders. Embrace failure, for it’s not the opposite of success; it’s a part of the journey. Let your faith be your guide, your tenacity your armor. Walk through the fire with your head held high, knowing that every scar, every bruise, is a mark of your unyielding spirit.</p>
                    <p>Because in the end, it’s not the victories that define us, but the struggles we overcome. It’s the unwavering faith and relentless tenacity that make us who we are. So, embrace the pain, celebrate the failures, and keep moving forward. For in this dance of faith and tenacity, we find our true strength, our true selves.</p>

                    <h2>Empathy</h2>
                    <p>Empathy is at the heart of my values, helping me connect deeply with others. It allows me to understand and share the feelings of those around me, fostering strong and meaningful relationships.</p>

                    <h2>Integrity</h2>
                    <p>Integrity shapes my actions, promoting honesty and transparency. It is the foundation of trust in both personal and professional relationships, ensuring that my actions align with my words.</p>

                    <h2>Growth and Learning</h2>
                    <p>Growth and learning drive me to continuously improve. I believe in the importance of lifelong learning and constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.</p>

                    <h2>Balance</h2>
