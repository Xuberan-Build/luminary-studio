# Episode 8: Interference - Values Collide

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

Interference happens when waves overlap. Constructive interference makes the signal stronger. Destructive interference cancels the signal. The same energy can amplify or disappear depending on alignment.

## Value Layer

Conflicting values reduce clarity. Aligned values amplify results. When your values and actions are out of sync, the signal weakens.

## Art and Sensory Layer

Waves overlap. Brightness surges and nulls. Noise versus harmony becomes visible.

## Product Tie-In

Team and Relationship Coherence Scan. Identify where values collide and where they reinforce.

## Why This Matters

When your values cancel each other, your momentum disappears. Alignment is not a preference, it is a power source.
