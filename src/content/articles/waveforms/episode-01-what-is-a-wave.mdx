# Episode 1: What Is a Wave?

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

A wave is a repeating pattern of change. A wave is not a thing - it is a pattern. Waves describe how energy, motion, and information move through a system. We see waves in sound, light, electricity, water, and data because waves are a language for change.

## Value Layer

A wave shows what changes and what stays the same. Stability and change are both values. A system that values stability creates consistent, steady patterns. A system that values change creates oscillation, variation, and rhythm. When you see a wave, you are watching a system express its priorities over time.

## Art and Sensory Layer

Imagine a single luminous sine wave on black. No color yet, just pure form. The motion is calm and steady, like breathing. The pattern is the story.

## Product Tie-In

Quantum Strategies Signal Library (Intro). One perfect looping waveform plus a glossary to anchor the language.

## Why This Matters

If your values feel random, your experience will feel chaotic. If your values are coherent, your experience becomes legible. The wave is the first pattern that makes coherence visible.
