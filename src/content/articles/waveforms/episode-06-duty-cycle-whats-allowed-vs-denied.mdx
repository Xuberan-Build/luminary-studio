# Episode 6: Duty Cycle - What Is Allowed vs Denied

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

Duty cycle measures how much of a signal is on versus off. Fifty percent means half on. Twenty percent means rarely on. Eighty percent means mostly on.

## Value Layer

Boundaries are values. Permission systems shape behavior. What you allow determines what can happen, and what you deny defines the edge of your world.

## Art and Sensory Layer

Pulse waves, threshold lines, light switching on and off. The pattern is less smooth and more decisive, like a gate.

## Product Tie-In

Boundary and Burnout Diagnostic. See where your on time is misaligned and where you need recovery.

## Why This Matters

If everything is on, nothing can be sustained. Duty cycle is the math of sustainability.
