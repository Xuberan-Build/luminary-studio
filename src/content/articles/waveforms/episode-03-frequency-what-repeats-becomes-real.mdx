# Episode 3: Frequency - What Repeats Becomes Real

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

Frequency measures repetition. High frequency means many repeats. Low frequency means few repeats. Repetition creates structure because what repeats becomes predictable.

## Value Layer

Value is principles and standards of behavior. Values show up as habits. What you repeat becomes normalized, and what you normalize becomes a system.

## Art and Sensory Layer

Wave density increases. Rhythm appears. You can feel the tempo even before you name it. Repetition becomes atmosphere.

## Product Tie-In

Habit Frequency Analyzer. Map daily behaviors to frequency patterns so you can see what you are truly repeating.

## Why This Matters

You become what you repeat. Frequency turns intention into structure, and structure becomes destiny if left unchecked.
