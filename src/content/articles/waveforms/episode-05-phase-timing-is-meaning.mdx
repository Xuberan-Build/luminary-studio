# Episode 5: Phase - Timing Is Meaning

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

Phase measures alignment in time. Two identical waves can be out of phase. Phase is not strength and not frequency. It is timing.

## Value Layer

Timing is a value judgment. Acting early or late changes outcomes. Timing is how you express respect for a moment, a person, or a system.

## Art and Sensory Layer

Two identical waves drift in and out of sync. Stereo sound offsets create tension and release. The same signal feels different depending on timing.

## Product Tie-In

Phase Alignment Planner. Use it to time launches, conversations, and decisions with greater precision.

## Why This Matters

You can do the right thing at the wrong time and still miss. Phase turns intent into impact.
