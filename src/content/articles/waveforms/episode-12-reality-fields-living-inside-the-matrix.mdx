# Episode 12: Reality Fields - Living Inside the Matrix

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

Perception is interpretation of values. Sensors and filters create feedback loops. A reality field is the lived environment shaped by what the system notices and rewards.

## Value Layer

What you value shapes what you notice. What you notice shapes your life. Reality is not random, it is patterned.

## Art and Sensory Layer

Coherent versus chaotic fields. Light versus dark as signal clarity. The loop closes with calm resolution.

## Product Tie-In

Quantum GPTs, Lunar Cycle Dinners, and ongoing field work. This is the ecosystem where the series becomes lived practice.

## Final Unifying Line

What we value creates our value. What we value makes our life light or dark. Reality is not random, it is patterned.
