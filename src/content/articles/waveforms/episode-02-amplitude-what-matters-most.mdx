# Episode 2: Amplitude - What Matters Most

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

Amplitude measures strength or intensity. High amplitude means a strong signal. Low amplitude means a weak signal. Amplitude does not change timing; it changes magnitude.

## Value Layer

Value is importance, worth, usefulness. What gets more energy is what matters more. Attention is amplitude. The things you amplify are the things you reward with time, emotion, and focus.

## Art and Sensory Layer

The same wave grows taller and brighter. Sound becomes louder, light becomes more vivid. Intensity is visible. The timing stays the same, but the impact changes.

## Product Tie-In

Personal Value Amplification Tool. Identify what you are currently amplifying and what you want to strengthen.

## Why This Matters

If your amplitude is assigned to the wrong signals, your life gets loud in the wrong places. The fix is not more time. The fix is calibrated intensity.
