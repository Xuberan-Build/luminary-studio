# Episode 4: Period - Time Is the Other Side of Value

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

Period is the length of one cycle. A shorter period means faster repetition. A longer period means slower repetition. Period tells you how long it takes for a pattern to complete itself.

## Value Layer

Time allocation is valuation. What you give time to reveals worth. When you compress a period, you intensify the value. When you stretch it, you signal patience or distance.

## Art and Sensory Layer

The same wave stretches and compresses, like a breath expanding and contracting. The rhythm changes, but the pattern remains intact.

## Product Tie-In

Time-Value Matrix. Visualize where your time goes and what it says about your priorities.

## Why This Matters

You can say you value something, but your calendar is the proof. Period exposes the truth of what you honor.
