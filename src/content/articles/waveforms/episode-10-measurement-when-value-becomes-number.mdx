# Episode 10: Measurement - When Value Becomes Number

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

Waves can be sampled and stored. Sampling turns a continuous signal into discrete data. Quantization turns experience into numbers. Measurement is the bridge between reality and systems.

## Value Layer

Value is measured worth. Metrics define success. Measurement shapes behavior, because what gets measured gets managed.

## Art and Sensory Layer

Wave to dots to grid. Color fades to grayscale. The signal becomes data. Clarity increases, nuance decreases.

## Product Tie-In

Reality Metrics Dashboard. A GPT-powered framework to define and track your value signals.

## Why This Matters

If you measure the wrong thing, you reward the wrong behavior. Measurement is the most subtle form of governance.
