# Episode 7: Wave Shapes - How Values Feel

## Core Spine

- A waveform is a system of values changing over time.
- What we value determines what we amplify.
- What we amplify becomes our experience.

## Concept

Shape affects experience. A sine wave is smooth. A square wave is abrupt. A triangle wave changes steadily. The pattern is the same idea expressed with a different character.

## Value Layer

Values do not just exist; they have style. How something is expressed matters as much as what is expressed. Tone, pacing, and texture are part of the value.

## Art and Sensory Layer

Shape morphing, timbre shifts in sound, texture introduced in the visual. The same frequency feels different depending on its form.

## Product Tie-In

Expression Style Mapper. Identify how you communicate value and where it needs refinement.

## Why This Matters

You can hold a powerful value and still repel people if the shape is wrong. The form of the value determines how it lands.
