**Question**:
```
Describe your current brand in 3-5 sentences. Include: your visual style, tone of voice, and how clients/customers perceive you.
```

**AI Prompt Focus**: Analyze current brand expression through chart placements. Identify coherence or misalignment between authentic waveform and current expression.

---

### Step 3: Visual Resonance
**Subtitle**: Colors, imagery, design language

**Question**:
```
What colors, imagery, and design styles naturally attract you? What visual aesthetics feel like "home"?
```

**AI Prompt Focus**: Map visual preferences to chart frequency. Validate natural resonance or surface unconscious misalignment. Use waveform language.

---

### Step 4: Communication Frequency
**Subtitle**: Your natural voice and tone

**Question**:
```
How do you naturally communicate? Are you direct or nuanced? Formal or casual? Analytical or intuitive?
```

**AI Prompt Focus**: Connect communication style to Mercury, Moon, and Rising placements. Identify where natural voice aligns with chart and where they may be code-switching.

---

### Step 5: Audience Alignment
**Subtitle**: Who you're here to serve

**Question**:
```
Describe your ideal client/customer. What are they seeking? What transformation do you provide?
```

---

### Step 6: Brand-Self Gaps

**Question**:
```
Where does your current brand expression feel inauthentic or forced? What are you doing "because you should" rather than because it resonates?

---

### Step 2: Life Satisfaction & Core Values
**Subtitle**: Let's discover what truly matters to you

**Question**:
```
Why This Matters:
Before you can build an aligned business, you need clarity on what matters most to YOU—not what you were taught to value, but what authentically drives you. Your chart reveals your natural value system.

Part 1: Current Life Alignment
Across all areas of your life (relationships, health, daily routine, personal growth, fulfillment), how aligned do you feel with who you truly are? Rate it 1-10.
(1 = living someone else's life, 10 = completely authentic)

Part 2: What Matters Most to You
Don't worry about naming "values" perfectly—just answer honestly:

• What lights you up? When do you feel most alive, most yourself?
• What would you never compromise on? Even if it cost you money, status, or approval?
• What makes you angry or frustrated? (This reveals violated values)
• If you could design your life with zero constraints, what would you prioritize?
• What do you admire most in others? What qualities draw you to people?
• What would you do even if no one paid or recognized you for it?

Think about these areas:

• Freedom vs. Security: Do you crave autonomy or stability?
• Growth vs. Comfort: Do you prioritize learning/expansion or peace/consistency?
• Connection vs. Independence: Do relationships or solitude energize you?
• Impact vs. Personal fulfillment: Do you want to change the world or perfect your craft?
• Authenticity vs. Harmony: Do you value truth-telling or keeping the peace?

Your Response:
Give your alignment rating (1-10) and explain why. Then answer the questions above in your own words. Don't overthink it—just share what genuinely matters to you. We'll help you identify your core values from what you share.
```

**Type**: Text response required, max 3 follow-ups

### Step 3: Energy Architecture & Daily Life
**Subtitle**: Understanding what fuels vs. depletes you

**Question**:
```
Why This Matters:
You have a unique energy design. Certain activities light you up, others drain you. Most people build lives around what drains them, then wonder why they're exhausted. Your Human Design type reveals how you're meant to operate.

Your Human Design Type Determines Your Energy:

• Generators (70% of people): Energy comes from RESPONDING to things that excite you
• Manifestors (9%): Energy comes from INITIATING new things when inspired
• Projectors (20%): Energy comes from being INVITED to guide others
• Reflectors (1%): Energy comes from being in ENVIRONMENTS that feel right

(Don't worry if you don't know your type—we'll tell you based on your chart)

Reflect On:

ENERGIZERS - What gives you life:
• What activities make you lose track of time?
• When do you feel most alive and engaged?
• What could you do for hours without feeling tired?
• What lights up your whole body when you think about it?

DRAINS - What depletes you:
• What do you procrastinate on or dread?
• What leaves you exhausted even if it's not physically demanding?
• What feels like obligation rather than opportunity?
• What makes you feel like you're dying inside?

Current Daily Reality:
• Describe a typical day from wake to sleep
• How much control do you have over your time and energy?
• What percentage of your day is energizing vs. draining?
• What would need to change for you to feel energized most of the time?

Your Response:
List specific activities that energize vs. drain you. Then describe your typical day. Be honest—we're looking for patterns, not judgment. The more specific you are, the clearer your energy architecture becomes.

Go Deep:
Notice patterns. Do you get energy from people or solitude? From creating or analyzing? From freedom or structure? From teaching or learning? Your body knows the truth—listen to it.
```

**Type**: Text response required, max 3 follow-ups

---

### Step 4: Identity Evolution & Life Vision
**Subtitle**: Who you were, who you are, who you're becoming

**Question**:
```
Why This Matters:
You're not meant to stay the same person forever. Identity evolution is natural and necessary. Your chart shows your growth direction—where you've been, where you are, and where you're being called. Most people feel guilty about outgrowing old versions of themselves. Your chart says it's necessary.

Reflect On:

Past Identity (5 years ago):
• What were your priorities and goals back then?
• What did you believe about yourself and the world?
• What version of yourself were you trying to be?
• What made you feel successful or valuable?

Present Identity (Now):
• How have your priorities shifted since then?
• What beliefs have changed?
• What matters to you now that didn't matter before?
• What used to matter that doesn't matter anymore?
• Where do you feel different from who you were?

Future Vision (Who You're Becoming):
If you could design your ideal life with no limitations, what would it look like?

• Morning: What time do you wake up? What's the first thing you do? Where are you? Who's there with you?
• Midday: What work are you doing (if any)? Where does income come from? Who are you collaborating with? How much control do you have over your schedule?
• Evening: How do you spend your free time? Who do you spend it with? What hobbies or passions do you pursue?
• Big Picture: What does your home look like? Where is it? What's your financial situation (specific number if possible)? What's your relationship status and quality? What impact are you making? What are you known for?

Most importantly:

• WHO are you BEING in this life (not just what you're doing)?
• How do you FEEL in your body in this future?
• What's the quality of your days—the energy, the pace, the purpose?

Your Response:
Describe who you were 5 years ago, who you are now, and who you're becoming. Then paint a picture of your ideal future life in vivid detail—from wake to sleep. Don't hold back. Don't edit for "realism." What does your soul actually want?

Go Deep:
This isn't about external circumstances alone (house, car, income). It's about the QUALITY of your experience. How do you FEEL in this life? What's the energy? The rhythm? The purpose? Let yourself dream without limits.
```

**Type**: Text response required, max 3 follow-ups

### Step 5: Life Purpose & Calling
**Subtitle**: What is your unique Life's Task?

**Question**:
```
Why This Matters:
Your Life's Task—what Robert Greene calls your unique calling—is not something you invent. It's something you discover. It's been there all along, showing up as recurring themes, persistent interests, natural talents, and a magnetic pull toward certain activities or subjects. Your chart reveals what you're here to do.

Your Life's Task Has These Qualities:

• It feels deeply personal and unique to you
• You've been drawn to it since childhood (in some form)
• It connects your natural gifts with meaningful contribution
• When you engage with it, you lose track of time
• It feels like play, even when it's challenging
• You'd do it even if no one paid you
• It creates value for others, not just you

Reflect On:

Recurring Themes:
• What subjects, topics, or problems have fascinated you across your entire life?
• What problems do you naturally notice and want to solve?
• What do people consistently come to you for help with?
• What injustices or inefficiencies make you angry or frustrated?

Natural Gifts:
• What comes easily to you that others struggle with?
• What do you do that makes people say "I could never do that" or "How did you do that?"
• What activities put you in flow state where time disappears?
• If you started a masterclass tomorrow, what would you teach?
• What would you do even if no one paid or recognized you for it?

Intersection Point:
Your Life's Task lives at the intersection of:

• What you're naturally good at (your gifts)
• What the world needs (problems you can solve)
• What you're deeply curious about (your interests)
• What creates transformation (your impact)

Consider Your Previous Responses:
Look back at what you've shared:

• Your core values (what matters most)
• Your energizers (what you could do forever)
• Your identity evolution (who you're becoming)
• Your vision (what life you're creating)

All of these point toward your Life's Task.

Your Response:
Based on everything you've shared—your values, energy, identity evolution, and vision—what do you sense is your Life's Task? What feels like your unique calling?

If you're not certain yet, that's completely okay. Share:

• What you're drawn to
• What themes keep appearing in your life
• What you sense you're here to do (even if it's vague)
• What you'd regret NOT doing with your life

Possible Frames to Help:

• "I'm here to help people..."
• "My calling is to create/build..."
• "I feel pulled toward..."
• "The world needs me to..."
• "I'm designed to be a bridge between..."
• "I can't NOT do..."

Go Deep:
Don't try to sound impressive or unique. Don't worry about how you'll monetize it yet (that's for Business Alignment Orientation). Just be honest about what calls to you. What feels like YOURS to do in this lifetime?

## Deliverable Quality Issues

### Issue 1: Inconsistent Specifications
- **Personal Alignment** has the most detailed generation instructions
- **Business Alignment** and **Structure/Profit** have vague section descriptions
- No products have example outputs

### Issue 2: Missing Word Count Guidance
- Only Personal Alignment specifies length (400-500 words)
- Business and Structure deliverables could be 300 words or 3000 words
- Inconsistent value perception

### Issue 3: Vague Section Instructions
**Example - Business Alignment**:
> "Astrological Overview - Key placements and what they mean for business strategy"

**Problems**:
- How many placements?
- How deep should interpretations go?
- What format (prose, bullets)?
- How long should this section be?

**Compare to Personal Alignment**:
> "Core Identity (3-4 sentences) - Their Sun/Moon/Rising essence in plain language, HD type/strategy/authority basics, Who they are at their core, how they're designed to operate"

Much more specific!

### Issue 4: No Quality Checks
None of the deliverable prompts include quality validation like:
- "Does this feel worth $[PRICE]?"
- "Is every section grounded in actual user responses?"
- "Are there specific quotes from user answers?"
- "Would the user feel SEEN?"

### Issue 5: Missing Synthesis Methodology
Only Personal Alignment has synthesis instructions:
> "Synthesize insights from all 5 steps into the blueprint"

Business and Structure don't explain HOW to synthesize across steps.

## Recommendations

### For Personal Alignment
**Issue**: Questions may be too long and overwhelming

**Options**:
1. **Keep depth, improve readability**: Use collapsible sections, progressive disclosure
2. **Simplify questions**: Break into sub-questions, reduce word count by 30%
3. **Hybrid approach**: Short question + "Learn more" expandable section

### For Business Alignment
**Issue**: Questions may be too brief, producing shallow responses

**Options**:
1. **Add context**: Brief "Why this matters" intro (50-100 words)
2. **Add examples**: Show what good answers look like
3. **Add prompts**: Bullet points to stimulate thinking

**Deliverable Issue**: Vague generation instructions

**Fix**:
1. Add word count (500-600 words recommended)
2. Add sentence counts per section
3. Add quality benchmark ("$500 consultation")
4. Add synthesis methodology

### For Structure/Profit/Scale
**Issue**: Questions are functional but lack strategic framing

**Options**:
1. **Add strategic context**: Why each question matters for scaling
